description: Use this checklist to self-diagnose your payment service before launch.

üí° Before deploying your service to production, check the details that are easy to miss to prevent
production failures.

## ‚úçÔ∏è All services

- **Configure i'mport console -> system settings with production settings**
  - [ ] Set PG Merchant ID / PG Secret.
  - [ ] Set test mode to OFF.
  - [ ] Set webhook (notification) URL.
  - [ ] Set IP security settings.
  - [ ] Check the credit card usage/merchant interest payment installment settings.
  - [ ] Set m\_redirect\_URL (for when using redirect mode (mobile/PayPal)).
  - [ ] Set confirm\_URL (for when using the service - must request to i'mport in advance)

- **Successful payment window call and result processing**
  - [ ] The payment window for the specified PG opened.

  - [ ] After payment, the result is successfully received via callback/via 302 redirect to
    m\_redirect\_url.

  - [ ] When the payment is completed (paid/canceled), the processing result is successfully
    received via webhook.

  - [ ] The received webhook data (result) is successfully updated in the system.

  - [ ] Responded to webhook with HTTP 200.

  - [ ] There is logic to handle the case when the result cannot be verified due to a communication
    error during payment/cancellation.

  - [ ] There is a reprocessing logic for each payment/cancellation failure reason. (Example: A
    failed cancellation can be reattempted.)

  - [ ] Provides or can instruct about the function to check the transaction details for
    payment/cancellation.

  - [ ] Can check the data for key items. (Approval number/imp\_uid/merchant\_uid)
