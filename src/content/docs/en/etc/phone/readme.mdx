**Mobile phone identity verification service** is used to confirm
the identity of the user and the accuracy of the user's identity information
submitted through the mobile phone under the user's name.

User's identity verification is needed to sign up for websites, make payments, or verify age.
You can perform identity verification by using the identity verification app
installed on a mobile device, or by submitting your identity information
(**name, date of birth, mobile phone number**) through the verification request page
and then confirming the verification number received via text message.
