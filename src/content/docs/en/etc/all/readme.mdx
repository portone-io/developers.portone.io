## What is an integrated identity verification service?

This is a service that verifies the identity of the person and the accuracy
of the information entered during the verification process through a private certificate,
such as KakaoTalk and Naver Certificate.
Integrated identity verification is provided through **KG Inicis**
and processed by using a private certificate or by sending a verification request
through the user's registered simple identity verification service.

> **Supported providers: Naver / PASS / Payco / TOSS / Financial Certificate / Kakao**
