## Merchant and sub-merchant accounts

- Merchant: A business with a unique business registration number
  except for agencies that develop payment service for other merchants.

- Sub-merchant: Merchants can manage and integrate payments through the Admin console
  by dividing its business by service, product line, region, etc.
  Such a division is defined as a sub-merchant.

  - Payment integration: The merchant can assign its payment methods and PGs
    to a specific sub-merchant from the Admin console.

  - Sub-merchant account: Sub-merchant accounts are limited to read-only access
    to features and payments associated with the sub-merchant.
