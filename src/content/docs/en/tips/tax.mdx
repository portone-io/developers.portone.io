This guide is intended for businesses who sell tax-free products and services as stipulated in [**Article 26 of the VAT Act (Supply of Tax-Free Goods or Services)**](https://txsi.hometax.go.kr/docs/customer/comment/comment_jomun_main_internet.jsp?node_id=null\&lawid=001571\&jomunkey=0026005\&lawnm=%EB%B6%80%EA%B0%80%EA%B0%80%EC%B9%98%EC%84%B8%EB%B2%95\&jomun_nm=%EC%A0%9C26%EC%A1%B0%E3%80%90%EC%9E%AC%ED%99%94%20%EB%98%90%EB%8A%94%20%EC%9A%A9%EC%97%AD%EC%9D%98%20%EA%B3%B5%EA%B8%89%EC%97%90%20%EB%8C%80%ED%95%9C%20%EB%A9%B4%EC%84%B8%E3%80%91\&public_ilja=20161220\&public_no=14387).

If you are a general business that does not sell the goods or services specified in this article,
you may skip this guide. A 10% VAT is automatically applied through the PG or credit card company
for such businesses.

## Getting Tax-free Merchant ID through PG Contract <a href="#pg" id="pg" />

If you are a **tax-free business**, you can submit a business registration card to prove your tax-exempt status when signing a PG contract. You will receive a merchant ID that allows you to set the following tax-free related properties when requesting a payment using `IMP.`<mark style="color:red;">**`request_pay`**</mark>.

- **`amount`**: total payment amount
- **`tax_free`**: tax free amount

Some PGs use a single merchant ID, without getting a separate tax-free merchant ID, for both taxable
and tax-free amounts. They set the `tax_free` property to indicate the tax-free portion of the
order.

<Hint style="info">
  **Merchant ID**

  The name of the merchant ID issued after applying for and signing a PG contract varies by PG. For example, the merchant ID for KG INICIS is `Merchant ID (MID)`, Kakao Pay is `Member Code (CID)`, and Naver Pay is `Partner ID`.
</Hint>

### Three types of merchant IDs can be issued according to your business's tax-exempt status.

> **Tax-free merchant ID**
>
> A tax-free merchant ID is issued to **businesses that only sell tax-free products and services**.
> If you make a transaction with a tax-free merchant ID, **all payments are tax exempted**
> regardless of the `tax-free` setting.

> **Taxable merchant ID**
>
> A taxable merchant ID is issued to **businesses that only sell taxable products and services**. If
> you make a transaction with a taxable merchant ID, **all payments are taxed** regardless of the
> `tax-free` setting.

> **Combination merchant ID**
>
> A combination merchant ID is issued to **businesses that sell both taxable and tax-free products
> and services**. You must use a combination merchant ID to set the tax-free amount for only the
> tax-free items.
>
> To pay for both taxable and tax-free items, specify the **total payment amount** for all items in
> the `amount` property, and the **total tax-free amount** for only tax-free items in the `tax_free`
> property.

<Hint style="warning">
  **`tax_free` is required**

  For transactions using combination merchant ID, you must set **both the `amount` and `tax_free` properties**. If the `tax_free` value is missing, an error may occur when you attempt to open the payment page for some PGs.

  Note that KG Inicis **processes all payments as tax-free**; if you change to a combination merchant ID while using a taxable merchant ID, all previous taxed payments are converted to tax-free payments.

## Applying tax\_free setting <a href="#taxfree" id="taxfree" />

The scenarios in this section show how to set the `amount` and `tax_free` properties when purchasing
tax-free and/or taxable items.

Assume that a flower business (tax-free business) sells tax-free plant seedlings and taxable vases
as follows:

- Plant seedlings: **tax-free**, 11,000 won each
- Vase: **subject to VAT**, 22,000 won each

## <mark style="color:blue;">CASE 01.</mark> Purchasing only tax-free items

For a purchase of one seedling, set the total payment amount to 11,000 won, and the total tax-free
amount to 11,000 won as follows:

```ts title="JavaScript"
IMP.request_pay(
  {
    amount: 11000, // total payment amount
    tax_free: 11000, // total tax-free amount
    // ...
  },
  function (rsp) {
    // ...
  },
);
```

In this case, the total amount of 11,000 won is tax-free, and the final payment is calculated as
follows (terminology may vary by PG):

- Total tax-free amount: 11,000 won
- VAT: 0 won

## <mark style="color:blue;">CASE 02.</mark> Purchasing only taxable items

For a purchase of one vase, set the total payment amount to 22,000 won, and the total tax-free
amount to 0 won as follows:

```ts title="JavaScript"
IMP.request_pay(
  {
    amount: 22000, // total payment amount
    tax_free: 0, // total tax-free amount
    // ...
  },
  function (rsp) {
    // ...
  },
);
```

In this case, a 10% VAT is applied to the total amount of 22,000 won, and the final payment is
calculated as follows:

- Total item price: 20,000 won
- VAT: 2,000 won

## <mark style="color:blue;">CASE 03.</mark> Purchasing both tax-free and taxable items

For a purchase of 3 seedlings and 1 vase, set the total payment amount to 55,000 (33,000 + 22,000)
won, and the total tax-free amount to 33,000 won (for seedlings) as follows:

```ts title="JavaScript"
IMP.request_pay(
  {
    amount: 55000, // total payment amount
    tax_free: 33000, // total tax-free amount
    // ...
  },
  function (rsp) {
    // ...
  },
);
```

In this case, a 10% VAT is applied to the total taxable amount of 22,000 won, and the final payment
is calculated as follows:

- Total item price: 20,000 won
- Total tax-free amount: 33,000 won
- VAT: 2,000 won
