How you obtain the payment result varies depending on how the payment window is loaded. In a typical PC environment, the payment window is loaded into an iframe, and in a mobile environment, it is loaded by redirecting to a new page.

When the payment process is completed successfully, you can receive the payment result based on the payment window type as follows:

|         iframe        |         Popup        |
| :-------------------: | :------------------: |
| **callback function** | **m\_redirect\_url** |

Refer to the following detailed instructions:

<ContentRef slug="/en/iframe" />

<ContentRef slug="/en/redirect" />
