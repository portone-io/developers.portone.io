<Hint style="info">
  **What is an iframe?**\
  It is a nested browser that effectively **embeds another HTML page into the current page**. By using the iframe element, **other pages can be loaded and inserted** into a web page without any restrictions.
</Hint>

Most payments that are processed in the PC environment can receive payment results
through the callback function, which is the second argument of the request\_pay() function.

<Hint style="success">
  For **PayPal** payments, the payment window is loaded as a **pop-up (new window)** in a PC environment and you can also receive the payment result through **m\_redirect\_url**.
</Hint>

> The following sample code processes the response to a payment request in **a typical PC
> environment** where the payment window is **loaded as iframe**.

Based on the the payment result (sucess/fail) in the response object
([**rsp**](../../../sdk/javascript-sdk/)) returned after the payment process is complete, add the
post-payment processing logic in the **callback** function. When the payment is successful, add the
logic to **send the payment ID (imp\_uid) and order ID (merchant\_uid) to the server** as shown
above.

> For information about the response parameter passed to the **callback** function, refer to [<mark style="color:red;">**rsp**</mark>](../../../sdk/javascript-sdk/undefined-1).

<Hint style="danger">
  The final payment result logic processing must be handled stably by using a [<mark style="color:red;">**webhook**</mark>](../../../result/webhook).
  If you don't set up a webhook, you may fail to receive the payment result.
