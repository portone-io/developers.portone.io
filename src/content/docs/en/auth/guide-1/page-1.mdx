Upon pre-agreement with a PG, you can request a one-time payment using the credit card information.
This method requests payment by submitting card information each time.
It is usually used by some merchants to avoid the hassle of authenticated payments or call centers
that obtain card information from customers via ARS to make a payment.
Recently, as more merchants are using a simple payment method for authenticated payments,
the use of key-in method is declining due to the inconvenience of having
to enter the card information every time.
