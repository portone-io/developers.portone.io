## What is a non-authenticated payment?

Non-authenticated payment refers to a payment method that pre-registers the credit card information
and requests a payment on the card without payer's authentication.

<Hint style="info">
  Although non-authenticated payments provides a simple way of making a payment without the payer's authentication, proceeding without payer authentication increases the likelihood of security issues during service operation. Hence, there are **stringent requirements for applying to use a PG** for non-authenticated payments.
</Hint>

### 1. Billing key payment

> **Making "recurring" payments using pre-registered payment information**

For Netflix or Apple Music subscription service, use this method to automatically make monthly
payments after entering the credit card information for the first month.

### 2. Key-in payment

> **Making payments by entering the credit card information without payer authentication
> (one-time payment)**

Key-in (manual input) payment is where a payment is processed without going through an
authentication step by simply entering the credit card information. Since this is a one-time payment
process and card information is not stored, you must enter your card information every time you make
a payment.
